<h1>Fitts' Law Study on Gaming Input Devices</h1>
<p>Author: Dylan Quach</p>
<p>Participants: Dylan Quach, Frank Quach</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For my study, I decided to test the performance difference between two gaming peripherals: an Oculus Rift S controller and a gaming mouse. Since the Oculus Rift S is a VR headset, 
I decided to use the HMD as the main display for testing both input devices. This was to prevent any bias with differing displays. The display was placed 1 meter away from the participants.
The Oculus Rift S uses these unique controllers shown below, and in this test, the participants were told to hold one controller with their dominant hand. 
The gaming mouse is a Glorious Model O- with its dpi (dots per linear inch) set to 2400. Also, a mouse bungee by Razer was used with the mouse to reduce the cord drag of the mouse. 
Mouse acceleration was also disabled in Windows for this test.</p>
<p>The test involves me and my father, Frank Quach. We took turns going through the FittsStudy program with the settings shown below. 
I went first and my father went after me. We started by first using the gaming mouse, and then we moved over to the VR controller. 
I predicted that the gaming mouse would be the better of the two devices to pointing, as we both use mice more often than we use VR controllers. 
However, the results tell a completely different story. </p>
<p>Looking at the average movement time and throughput for both of my trials, it's clear that the Oculus Rift controller is the better device for pointing. 
The average movement time is nearly 200 ms faster with the VR controller, and my average throughput is over 1 bit/s higher (nearly 3 bits/s if we look at the TP_inv value). 
It's about the same for my father's trials as well, although to a much lesser degree than mine. 
My father's average movement time was a bit slower on the VR controller (7 ms slower, which is almost nothing), while his average throughput is higher by about .06 bits/s.
When we calculate the average throughput of both of our results, we see that the Oculus Rift S controller has the higher throughput of the two input devices.
Going off of that, it appears that the Oculus Rift controller is a better pointing device when compared to a gaming mouse. 
However, I believe that I'll need more test data before I say anything truly conclusive.<br><br>
